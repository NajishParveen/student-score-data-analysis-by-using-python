Student Score Data Analytics
This project uses Python to analyze and visualize student performance data. It helps identify trends, compare subject scores, and understand overall academic outcomes through statistical methods and clear visualizations. Using tools like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the project performs data cleaning, descriptive analysis, and exploratory data visualization. It‚Äôs a simple and effective way to apply data analytics in education.
üîç Key Features
Clean and preprocess student score data (CSV/Excel)

Generate statistics (mean, median, std dev, etc.)

Visualize score trends with histograms, box plots, heatmaps

Identify top performers and students needing support

Compare scores by subject, gender, or class
üìä Student Score Data Analytics with Python
This project focuses on analyzing student academic performance using Python. It applies data analytics techniques to explore, visualize, and understand patterns in student scores, helping educators and analysts make data-driven decisions.

Using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the project covers the full data analysis workflow‚Äîfrom data cleaning to insightful visualizations. The analysis includes descriptive statistics, subject-wise comparisons, score distributions, and correlation analysis (e.g., between study hours and grades).

The code is modular and organized for use in scripts or Jupyter Notebooks, making it easy to adapt for different datasets or educational use cases.
